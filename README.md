# Unity_TestingArround
Just testing and messing arround with Unity Game Engine.

My name is Jo√£o Figueiredo and I'm 19 years old. I study computer engineering and currently work at SoftINSA (IBM's Group).
I'm from Portugal and I love programming. Games Always have been a passion to me. So I'm starting to get some knowledge in this area.
This is just a Test Project so I can mess arround with Unity Game Engine features and try to learn what can I do with it.

I'm open to new ideas and any help is welcome.

I hope don't give up on this so here it goes the not giving up "clock":
